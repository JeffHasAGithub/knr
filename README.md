# K&R solutions

This repo contains my solutions to the practice problems found in Kernighan and Ritchie's *The C Programming Language* book. I do take the time to test my answers for correctness but I cannot guarantee that there are not edge cases that I have not considered.

If you are looking for the definitive solutions to these problems, I would recommend that you purchase the *The C Answer Book* by Tondo and Gimpel. Additionally, there are other repos on Github with solutions that have been more thoroughly tested and vetted.

As a side note, I did not use any language features that had not been introduced by the book at the time a particular problem appears.

## This is an ongoing effort. I am currently about half through the book.
